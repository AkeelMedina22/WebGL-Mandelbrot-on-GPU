## About The Project

Doing the Mandelbrot calculation directly via the fragment shader was the goal of this project. Attention was also paid to how efficient it could be. In the future I will add a zoom feature.

### Built With

* [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/)

### Instructions:

Run mandelbrot-gpu.html on your web browser for the render of Mandelbrot. The slider indicates the number of iterations for the equation to the Mandelbrot Set.
