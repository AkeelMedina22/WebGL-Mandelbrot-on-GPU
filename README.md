## About The Project

This is a question from CS 440 Computer Graphics offered at Habib University in Fall 2021.

Rendering Mandelbrot using WebGL is much simpler when simply passing calculated colors to the fragment shader. To do the majority of calculation directly via the fragment shader, using GLSL, was the goal of this question.

### Built With

* [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/)

### Instructions:

Run mandelbrot-gpu.html on your web browser for the render of Mandelbrot. The slider indicates the number of iterations for the equation to the Mandelbrot Set.
